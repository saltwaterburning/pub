    Documentation of DOME RESTful APIs for use by the MRO (Maintenance, Repair and Operations) Collaboration and WST (Workscope Tool) systems.

    This documentation is generated from the actual DOME OpenAPI Specification so is the most authoritative possible.
    Every effort was made to make the DOME and it's external APIs adherent the best-of-breed architectural design patterns and recommendations such as those by the
    <a href="https://www.ietf.org/about/introduction/#about" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) for standards development for the Internet</a>.

    **DOME Application Monitoring**

    The DOME application has a large number of monitoring and management features available.
    In order to maintain operational security only a small number of these are enabled in production.

    One monitor of note is the *GET /monitor/health* endpoint is available for monitoring the DOME application health.
    The HTTP status code reflects the DOME application health as listed below.
    The health monitor response details are described <a href="https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/api/rest/actuator/health.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a>.
    In certain scenarios the response details may not be available so it's advised to rely upon the HTTP status code.
    The health monitor also reports the health of a few application components such as DB and diskSpace.

    * Application health monitor HTTP Status Codes
        * **UP**: 200 (OK)
        * **DOWN**: 503 (Service Unavailable)
        * **OUT_OF_SERVICE**: 410 (Gone)
        * **UNKNOWN**: 500 (Internal Server Error)
